Ideas:
Seperate open world levels into their own campaign
Camera has a path from the golden acorn to the player to give player a sense of the level

The first tap may give a side boost (useful for stopping suddenly)
Some way to compare your scores with friends
Implement a shop to spend money
Add items that give cosmetic effects
Histogram to show players score vs. a percent of the world
Add a campaign, or reason to proceed in game
Launch type level in Forest, or a map with heavier gravity.  Kinda like doodle jump.

TEST:
Parameter injection attacks (Avoid high score from being cheated).


Long Term
Online high score system

World Design
Level select is a map of an area.  Ice is in a mountain, ocean, etc.
