The first tap may give a side boost (useful for stopping suddenly)

Implement a shop to spend money
Add items that give cosmetic effects
Histogram to show players score vs. a percent of the world
Add a campaign, or reason to proceed in game
Launch type level in Forest, or a map with heavier gravity.  Kinda like doodle jump
