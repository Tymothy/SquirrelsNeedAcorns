Ideas:
Add a secret star in each level?
Make the super acorns a money to use for collections.  Save per level so as you collect them, they disappear.  (maybe replaced with a ghost acorn?).
The first tap may give a side boost (useful for stopping suddenly)
Some way to compare your scores with friends
Implement a shop to spend money
Add items that give cosmetic effects
Histogram to show players score vs. a percent of the world
Add a campaign, or reason to proceed in game

TEST:
Parameter injection attacks (Avoid high score from being cheated).
